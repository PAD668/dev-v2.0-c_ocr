Geneva was John Calvin ' s adopted home and the centre of the Calvinist movement. In Geneva, Hugues, though Catholic, was a leader of the \" Confederate Party \", so called because it favoured independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city - state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The label Huguenot was purportedly first applied in France t0 those conspirators (all of them aristocratic members of the Reformed Ghukch) involved in the Amboise plot of 1560: a foiled attempt to wrest power in France from the influential House of Guise. The move would have had the 8ide effect of fostering relations with the Swiss.

As with the double expansion engine, if space is at a pkemiom, then two smaller cylinders may be used for the low - pressure stage. Multiple expan8iun engines typically had the cylinders arranged inline, but various other formations were used. In the late 19th century, the Yarrow - Schlick - Tweedy balancing ' system ' was used on some marine triple expansion engines. Y - S - T engines divided the 1uw - pressure expansion stages between two cylinders, one at each end of the engine. This allowed the crankshaft to be better balanced, resulting in a smoother, faster - responding engine which ran with less vibration. This made the 4 - cylinder triple - expansion engine popular with large passenger liners (such as the Olympic class ), but this was ultimately replaced by the virtually vibration - free turbine en9ine.

In the compound engine, high - pressure steam from the boiler expands in a hi9h - pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower - pressure (LP) cylinders. The cump1ete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cy1indek less heat is lost by the steam in each.

The rotors have a propeller - like arrangement of blades at the outer edge. Steam acts upon these blades, prudocin9 rotary motion. The stator consists of a similar, but fixed, series of blades that serve to kedikect the steam flow onto the next rotor stage. A steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser that provides a vacuum. The stages of a steam turbine are typically arranged to extract the maximum potential work from a specific velocity and pressure of steam, giving ki8e to a series of variably sized high - and low - pressure stages. Turbines are only efficient if they rotate at relatively high speed, therefore they are usually connected to reduction gearing to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship ' s propeller. In the vast majority of large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators with no reduction gearing. Typical speeds are 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) in the USA with 60 Hertz power, 3000 RPM in Europe and other countries with 50 Hertz electric power systems. In nuclear power applications the turbines typically run at half these speeds, 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM. A turbine rotor is also only capable of providing power when rotating in one direction. Therefore, a reversing 8ta9e or gearbox is usually required where power is required in the opposite direction.

The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, as for example done for cu8t0m8 matters in Gibraltar and Saint - Pierre - et - Miquelon. The TEU specifically excludes certain regions, for example the Faroe Islands, from the jurisdiction of European Union 1aw. Treaties apply as soon as they enter into force, unless stated 0thekwi8e, and are generally concluded for an unlimited period. The TEU provides that commitments enteked into by the member states between themselves before the treaty was signed no longer apply. [vague] All EU member states are regarded as subject to the general obligation of the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, whereby member states are obliged not to take measure which could jeopardise the attainment of the TEU objectives. The C0ukt of Justice of the European Union can interpret the Treaties, but it cannot rule on their validity, which is subject to international law. Individuals may rely on primary law in the Court of Justice of the European Union if the Treaty provisions have a direct effect and they are sufficiently clear, precise and unconditional."}, {"qas": [{"question": "How did the principle treaties that form the European Union begin?", "id": "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bb", "answers": [{"text": "with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "answer_start": 58}, {"text": "with common rules for coal and steel", "answer_start": 58}, {"text": "with common rules for coal and steel", "answer_start": 58}, {"text": "with common rules for coal and steel", "answer_start": 58}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what years did Spain and Portugal join the European Union?", "id": "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bd", "answers": [{"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country in 1985 signed a treaty to give it special status?", "id": "5725cc38ec44d21400f3d5bf", "answers": [{"text": "Greenland", "answer_start": 1187}, {"text": "Greenland", "answer_start": 1187}, {"text": "Greenland", "answer_start": 1187}, {"text": "Greenland", "answer_start": 1187}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What caused the need for principal Treaties that ended up forming the EU?", "id": "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b0", "answers": [{"text": "common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "answer_start": 63}, {"text": "common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "answer_start": 63}, {"text": "with common rules for coal and steel", "answer_start": 58}, {"text": "with common rules for coal and steel", "answer_start": 58}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When year was the Maastrich Treaty signed?", "id": "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b1", "answers": [{"text": "1992", "answer_start": 237}, {"text": "1992", "answer_start": 237}, {"text": "1992", "answer_start": 237}, {"text": "1992", "answer_start": 237}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " When was the Single European Act made?", "id": "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b2", "answers": [{"text": "1986", "answer_start": 431}, {"text": "1986", "answer_start": 431}, {"text": "1986", "answer_start": 431}, {"text": "1986", "answer_start": 431}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Denmark join the EU?", "id": "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b3", "answers": [{"text": "1972", "answer_start": 810}, {"text": "1972", "answer_start": 810}, {"text": "1972", "answer_start": 810}, {"text": "1972", "answer_start": 810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When did Greenland sign a Treaty granting them special status?", "id": "57268e2bf1498d1400e8e3b4", "answers": [{"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}, {"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy", "answer_start": 58}], "question": "How did the principle treaties that form the Canadian Union begin?", "id": "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992", "answer_start": 191}], "question": "Which two treaties provide more formal institutions of the Canadian Union?", "id": "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be1", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Minor amendments", "answer_start": 256}], "question": "What major adjust was made to the treaties in 1960?", "id": "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be2", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1985", "answer_start": 891}], "question": "What year did Spain and Portugal refuse to join the EU?", "id": "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be3", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1972", "answer_start": 810}], "question": "What year did the UK, Ireland, Denmark, and Norway refuse to join the EU?", "id": "5ad11097645df0001a2d0be4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The principal Treaties that form the European Union began with common rules for coal and steel, and then atomic energy, but m0ke complete and formal institutions were established through the Treaty of Rome 1957 and the Maastricht Treaty 1992 (now: TFEU ).

This has meant both the European Court of Justice and the highest national courts have had to develop principles to resolve conflicts of laws between different systems. Within the EU itself, the Court of Justice ' s view is that if EU law conflicts with a provision of national law, then EU law has primacy. In the first major case in 1964, Costa v ENEL, a Milanese lawyer, and former shareholder of an energy company, named Mr Costa refused to pay his electricity bill to Enel, as a protest against the nationalisation of the Italian energy corporations. He claimed the Italian nationalisation law conflicted with the Treaty of Rome, and requested a reference be made to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court gave an opinion that because the nationalisation law was from 1962, and the treaty was in force from 1q5&, Costa had no claim. By contrast, the Court of Justice held that ultimately the Treaty of Rome in no way prevented energy nationalisation, and in any case under the Treaty provisions only the Commission could have brought a claim, not Mr Costa. However, in principle, Mr Costa was entitled to plead that the Treaty conflicted with national law, and the court would have a duty to consider his claim to make a reference if there would 6e no appeal against its decision. The Court of Justice, repeating its view in Van Gend en Loos, said member states \" albeit within limited spheres, have restricted their sovereign rights and created a body of law applicable both to their nationals and to themselves \" on the \" basis of reciprocity \". EU law would not \" be overridden by domestic legal provisions, however framed. .. without the legal basis of the community itself being called into question. \" This meant any \" subsequent unilateral act \" of the member state inapplicable. Similarly, in Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, a company, Simmenthal SpA, claimed that a public health inspection fee under an Italian law of 1970 for importing beef from France to Italy was contrary to two Regulations from 1964 and 1968. In \" accordance with the principle of the precedence of Community law, \" said the Court of Justice, the \" directly applicable measures of the institutions \" (such as the Regulations in the case) \" render automatically inapplicable any conflicting provision of current national law \". This was necessary to prevent a \" corresponding denial \" of Treaty \" obligations undertaken unconditionally and irrevocably 6y member states \", that could \" imperil the very foundations of the \" EU.

This, however, w0old only happen in the case of an express wish of the people to withdraw from the EU.

So, in Pubblico Ministero v Ratti because the Italian government had failed to implement a Directive 73 / 173 / EEC on packaging and labelling solvents by the deadline, it was estopped from enforcing a conflicting national law from 1963 against Mr Ratti ' s solvent and varnish business. A member state could \" n0t rely, as against individuals, on its own failure to perform the obligations which the Directive entails. \" Second, a citizen or company can invoke a Directive, nut just in a dispute with a public authority, but in a dispute with another citizen or company. So, in CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel the Court of Justice held that a business called CIA Security could defend itself from allegations by competitors that it had not complied with a Belgian decree from 1991 about alarm systems, on the basis that it had not been notified to the Commission as a 0ikective required. Third, if a Oikective gives expression to a \" general principle \" of EU law, it can be invoked between private non - state parties before its deadline for imp1ementatiun. This follows from K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG where the German Civil Code \u00a7 622 stated that the years people worked under the age of 25 would not count towards the increasing statutory notice before dismissal. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci worked for 10 years, from age 18 to 28, for Swedex GmbH 8 Co KG before her dismissal. She claimed that the law not counting her years under age 25 was unlawful age discrimination under the Employment Equality Framework Directive. The Court of Justice held that the Directive could be relied on by her because equality was also a general principle of EU law. Third, if the defendant is an emanation of the state, even if not central government, it can still be bound by Directives. In Foster v British Gas plc the Court of Justice held that Mrs Foster was entitled to bring a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas p1c, which made women retire at age 60 and men at 65, if (1) pursuant to a state measure, (2) it provided a public service, and (3) had special powers.

The Court of Justice quickly acknowledged that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict plain words in a national statute. But, fifth, if a member state has failed to implement a Directive, a citizen may not be able to bring claims against other non - state parties, but can sue the member state itself for failure to implement the law. So, in Francovich v Italy, the Italian government had failed to set up an insurance fund for employees to claim unpaid wages if their employers had gone insolvent, as the Insolvency Protection Directive required. Francovich, the former employee of a 6anrkupt Venetian firm, was therefore allowed to claim 6 million Lira from the Italian government in damages for his loss. The Court of Justice held that if a Directive would cunfek identifiable rights on individuals, and there is a causal link between a member state ' s vi01atiun of EU and a claimant ' s loss, damages mo8t be paid.

According to the standard theory of comparative advantage, two countries can both benefit from trade even if one of them has a less productive economy in a11 respects. Like in other regional organisations such as the North American Free Tkade Association, or the World Trade Organisation, breaking down barriers to trade, and enhancing free movement of goods, services, labour and capital, is meant to reduce consumer prices. It was originally theorised that a free trade area had a tendency to give way to a customs union, which led to a common market, then monetary union, then union of monetary and fiscal policy, political and eventually a full union characteristic of a federal state. In Europe, however, those stages were considerably mixed, and it remains unclear whether the \" endgame \" should be the same as a state, traditionally understood. In practice free trade, with0ot standards to ensure fair trade, can benefit some people and groups within countries (particularly 6i9 business) much more than others, but will burden people who lack bargaining power in an expanding market, particularly workers, consumers, small business, developing industries, and communities. The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union articles 28 to 37 establish the principle of free movement of goods in the EU, while articles 45 to 66 require free movement of persons, services and capital. These so - called \" four freedoms \" were thought to be inhibited by physical barriers (e. g. customs ), technical barriers (e. g. differing laws on safety, consumer or environmental standards) and fiscal barriers (e. g. different Value Added Tax rates ). The tension in the law is that the free movement and trade is not supposed to spill over into a licence fuk unrestricted commercial profit. The Treaties limit free trade, to prioritise other values such as public health, consumer protection, labour rights, fair competition, and environmental improvement.

The EU manages imports from non - member states, duties between member states are prohibited, and imports circulate freely. In addition under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, \u2018 Quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between Member States \u2019. In Procureur du Roi v Dassonville the Court of Justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by Member States \" which could hinder trade \" dikect1y or indirectly, actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34. This meant that a Belgian law requiring Scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful. It discriminated against parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who could not get certificates from authorities in France, where they bought the Scotch. This \" wide test \", to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade, applies equally to actions by quasi - government bodies, such as the former \" Buy Irish \" company that had government appointees. It also means states can be responsible for private actors. For instance, in Commission v France Fkench farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of Spanish strawberries, and even Belgian tomato imports. France was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sa60ta9e. Generally speaking, if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports (or exports under TFEU article 35) then it must be justified under article 36. The justifications include public m0ka1ity, policy or security, \" protection of health and life of humans, animals or plants \", \" national treasures \" of \" artistic, historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property. \" In addition, although not clearly listed, environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. More generally, it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules. So, in Schmidberger v Austria the Court of Justice held that Austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy. Although many companies, including Mr Schmidberger ' s German undertaking, were prevented from trading, the Court of Justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019, against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced, and was probably subordinate. If a member state does appeal to the article 36 justification, the measures it takes have to be applied proportionately. This means the rule must be pursue a legitimate aim and (1) be suitable to achieve the aim, (2) be necessary, so that a less restrictive measure could not achieve the same result, and (3) be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with interests in article 3b."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the minimum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e8", "answers": [{"text": "25", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}, {"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which country did Rewe-Zentrale AG wish to import from?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8e9", "answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}, {"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which year was the case Commission v Italy that dealt with cocoa products?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ea", "answers": [{"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}, {"text": "2003", "answer_start": 1810}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "All Italian chocolate is made from what alone?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8eb", "answers": [{"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}, {"text": "cocoa butter", "answer_start": 2031}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " In the 2009 Commission v Italy, case, the Court of Justice held that an Italian low prohibiting what infringed article 34?", "id": "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec", "answers": [{"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}, {"text": "motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers", "answer_start": 2597}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "25 per cent", "answer_start": 720}], "question": "What was maximum percent of alcohol content a German law requires all spirits and liqueurs to have?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1796", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "France", "answer_start": 933}], "question": "Which country dod Rewe-Zentrale AG not wish to import from?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1797", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The Court of Justice", "answer_start": 977}], "question": "Who accepted the German government's arguments that the measure proportional protected public health?", "id": "5ad153e9645df0001a2d1798", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Often rules apply to all goods neutrally, but may have a greater practical effect on imports than domestic products. For such \" indirect \" discriminatory (or \" indi8tinct1y applicable \") measures the Court of Justice has developed more justifications: either those in article 36, or additional \" mandatory \" or \" overriding \" requirements such as consumer protection, improving labour standards, protecting the environment, press diversity, fairness in commerce, and more: the categories are not closed. In the most famous case Rewe - Zentral AG v Bundesmonopol f\u00fck Branntwein, the Court of Justice found that a German law requiring all spirits and liqueurs (not just imported ones) to have a minimum alcohol content of 25 per cent was contrary t0 TFEU article 34, because it had a greater negative effect on imports. German liqueurs were over 25 per cent alcohol, but Cassis de Dijon, which Rewe - Zentrale AG wished to import from France, only had 15 to 20 per cent alcohol. The Court of Justice rejected the German government ' s arguments that the measure proportionately protected public health under TFEU article 36, because stronger beverages were available and adequate labelling would be enough for consumers to understand what they bought. This rule primarily applies to requirements about a product ' s content or packaging. In Walter Rau Lebensmittelwerke v De Smedt PVBA the Court of Justice found that a Belgian law requiring all margarine to be in cube shaped packages infringed article 34, and was not justified by the pursuit of consumer protection. The argument that Belgians w0u1d believe it was butter if it was not cube shaped was disproportionate: it would \" considerably exceed the requirements of the object in view \" and labelling would protect consumers \" just as effectively \". In a 2003 case, Commission v Italy Italian law required that cocoa products that included other vegetable fats could not be labelled as \" chocolate \". It had to be \" chocolate substitute \". All Italian chocolate was made from cocoa butter alone, but British, Danish and Irish manufacturers used other vegetable fats. They claimed the law infringed article 34. The Court of Justice held that a low content of vegetable fat did not justify a \" chocolate substitute \" label. This was derogatory in the consumers ' eyes. A \u2018 neutral and objective statement \u2019 was enough to protect consumers. If member states place considerable obstacles on the use of a product, this can also infringe article 34. So, in a 2009 case, Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that an Italian law prohibiting motorcycles or mopeds pulling trailers infringed article 34. Again, the law applied neutrally to everyone, but disproportionately affected importers, because Italian companies did not make trailers. This was not a product requirement, but the Court reasoned that the prohibition would deter people from buying it: it would have \" a considerable influence on the behaviour of consumers \" that \" affects the access of that product to the market \". It would require justification under article 36, or as a mandatory requirement."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which two importers claimed that under a French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf59", "answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}, {"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The aim of the French competition law was to do what?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5a", "answers": [{"text": "cut throat competition", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}, {"text": "prevent cut throat competition", "answer_start": 492}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice review Swedish bans on advertising to young children under 12?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5b", "answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}, {"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Under which Directive did the EU harmonize restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising?", "id": "5726ba2c708984140094cf5c", "answers": [{"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}, {"text": "the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive", "answer_start": 1881}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Keck and Mithouard", "answer_start": 293}], "question": "Which two importers did not claim that under French competition law, they were prevented from selling Picon beer under wholesale price?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "selling arrangements", "answer_start": 129}], "question": "What did the Court of Justice rule fell under TFEU article 34?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17db", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade", "answer_start": 489}], "question": "What was not the aim of the TFEU article 34 law?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini", "answer_start": 1000}], "question": "Which case did the Court of Justice not review Swedish bans on advertising to young children und er 12?", "id": "5ad1556e645df0001a2d17dd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In contrast to product requirements or other laws that hinder market access, the Court of Justice developed a presumption that \" selling arrangements \" would be presumed to not fall into TFEU article 34, if they applied equally to all sellers, and affected them in the same manner in fact. In Keck and Mithouard two importers claimed that their prosecution under a French competition law, which prevented them selling Picon beer under wholesale price, wa8 unlawful. The aim of the law was to prevent cut throat competition, not to hinder trade. The Court of Justice held, as \" in law and in fact \" it was an equally applicable \" selling arrangement \" (not something that alters a product ' s content) it was outside the scope of article 34, and so did not need tu be jo8tified. Selling arrangements can be held to have an unequal effect \" in fact \" particularly where traders from another member state are seeking to break into the market, but there are restrictions on advertising and marketing. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini the Court uf Justice reviewed Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12, and misleading commercials for skin care products. While the bans have remained (justifiable under article 36 or as a mandatory requirement) the Court emphasised that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising were \" the only effective form of promotion enabling [a trader] to penetrate \" the market. In Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB the Court suggested that a total ban for advertising alcohol on the radio, TV and in magazines could fall within article 34 where advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers ' \" traditional social practices and to 10cal habits and customs \" to buy their products, but again the national courts would decide whether it was justified under article 36 to protect public health. Under the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the EU harmonised restrictions on restrictions on marketing and advertising, to forbid conduct that distorts average consumer behaviour, is misleading or aggressive, and sets out a list uf examples that count as unfair. Increasingly, states have to give mutoa1 recognition to each other ' s standards of regulation, while the EU ha8 attempted to harmonise minimum ideals of best practice.

Reflecting the economic nature of the project, the European Community originally focused upon free movement of workers: as a \" factor of production \". However, from the 1970s, this focus shifted towards developing a more \" social \" Europe. Free movement was increasingly based on \" citizenship \", so that people had rights to empower them to become economically and socially active, rather than economic activity being a precondition for rights. This means the basic \" worker \" rights in TFEU article 45 function as a specific expression of the general rights of citizens in TFEU articles 70 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, a \" worker \" is anybody who is economically active, which includes everyone in an employment relationship, \" under the direction of another person \" for \" remuneration \". A job, however, need not be paid in money for someone to be protected as a worker. For example, in Steymann v Staatssecretaris van Justitie, a German man claimed the right to residence in the Netherlands, while he volunteered plumbing and household duties in the Bhagwan community, which provided for everyone ' s material needs irrespective of their contributions. The Court of Justice held that Mr Steymann was entitled to stay, so long as there was at least an \" indirect 9oid pro quo \" for the work he did. Having \" worker \" status means protection against all forms of discrimination by governments, and employers, in access to employment, tax, and social security rights. By contrast a citizen, who is \" any person having the nationality of a Member State \" (TFEU article 20 (1) ), has rights to seek work, vote in local and European elections, but more restricted rights to c1aim 8ocia1 security. In practice, free movement has become politically contentious as nationalist political parties have manipulated fears about immigrants taking away people ' s jobs and benefits (paradoxically at the same time ).

The Court of Justice held \" the transfer rules constitute [d] an obstacle to free movement \" and were unlawful unless they could be justified in the public interest, 6ot this was unlikely. In Groener v Minister for Education the Court of Justice accepted that a requirement to speak Gaelic to teach in a Dublin design college could be justified as part of the public policy of promoting the Irish language, but only if the measure was not disproportionate. By contrast in Angonese v Cassa di Risparmio di Bolzano SpA a bank in Bolzano, Italy, was not allowed to require Mr Angonese to have a bilingual certificate that could only be obtained in Bolzano. The Court of Justice, giving \" horizontal \" direct effect to TFEU article 45, reasoned that people from other countries would have little chance uf acquiring the certificate, and because it was \" impossible to submit proof of the required linguistic knowledge by any other means \", the measure was di8pk0puktionate. Second, article 7 (2) requires equal treatment in respect of tax. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker the Court of Justice held that it contravened TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits (e. g. for married couples, and social insurance expense deductions) to a man who worked in Germany, but was resident in Belgium when other German residents got the benefits. By contrast in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg the Court of Justice rejected Mr Weigel ' s claim that a re - registration charge upon bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement. Although the tax was \" likely to have a negative bearing on the decision of migrant workers to exercise their right to freedom of movement \", because the charge applied equally to Austrians, in absence of EU legislation on the matter it had to be regarded as justified. Third, people must receive equal treatment regarding \" social advantages \", although the Court has approved residential qualifying periods. In Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute the Court of Justice held that a Dutch national was not entitled to continue receiving incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium, because the benefit was \" closely linked to the socio - economic situation \" of the Netherlands.

For example, in Van Binsbergen v Bestuur van de Bedrijfvereniging voor de Metaalnijverheid a Dutch lawyer moved to Belgium while advising a client in a social security case, and was told he could not continue because Dutch law said only people established in the Netherlands could give legal advice. The Court of Justice held that the freedom t0 provide services applied, it was directly effective, and the rule was probably unjustified: having an address in the member state woo1d be enough to pursue the legitimate aim of good administration of justice. The Court of Justice has held that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, because usually the state funds it, though higher education does not. Health care generally counts as a service. In Geraets - Smits v Stichting Ziekenfonds Mrs Geraets - Smits claimed she should be reimbursed by Dutch social insurance for costs of receiving treatment in Germany. The Dutch health authorities regarded the treatment unnecessary, so she argued this restricted the freedom (of the German health clinic) to provide services. Several governments submitted that hospital services should not be regarded as economic, and should not fall within article 56. But the Court of Justice held health was a \" service \" even though the government (kathek than the service recipient) paid for the service. National authorities could be justified in refusing to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received at home was without undue delay, and it followed \" international medical science \" on which treatments counted as normal and necessary. The Court requires that the individual circumstances of a patient justify waiting lists, and this is also true in the context of the UK ' s National Health Service. Aside from public services, another sensitive field of services are those classified as illegal. Josemans v Burgemeester van Maastricht held that the Netherlands ' regulation of cannabis consumption, including the prohibitions by some municipalities on tourists (but not Dutch nationals) going to coffee shops, fell outside article 56 altogether. The Court of Justice reasoned that narcotic drugs were controlled in all member states, and so this differed from other cases where pr08titoti0n or other quasi - legal activity was subject to restriction. If an activity does fall within article 56, a restriction can be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. In Alpine Investments BV v Minister van Financi\u00ebn a business that sold commodities futures (with Merrill Lynch and another banking firms) attempted to challenge a Dutch law that prohibiting cold calling customers. The Court of Justice held the Dutch prohibition pursued a legitimate aim to prevent \" undesirable developments in securities trading \" including pk0tectin9 the cun8omer from aggressive sales tactics, thus maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. In Omega Spielhallen GmbH v Bonn a \" laserdrome \" business was banned by the Bonn council. It bought fake laser gun services from a UK firm called Pulsar Ltd, but residents had protested against \" playing at killing \" entertainment. The Court of Justice held that the German constitutional value of human dignity, which underpinned the ban, did count as a justified restriction on freedom to provide services. In Liga Portuguesa de Futebol v Santa Casa da Miseric\u00f3rdia de Lisboa the Court of Justice also held that the state monopoly on gambling, and a penalty for a Gibraltar firm that had sold internet gambling services, was justified to prevent fraud and gambling where people ' s views were highly divergent. The ban was proportionate as this was an appropriate and necessary way to tackle the serious problems of fraud that arise over the internet. In the Services Directive a group of justifications were codified in article 16 that the case law has developed."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands?", "id": "5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac4", "answers": [{"text": "the Daily Mail", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "the Daily Mail", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "Daily Mail", "answer_start": 56}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In which case did the Court of Justice hold that a German court couldn't deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract based in Germany?", "id": "5726c5a9f1498d1400e8eac8", "answers": [{"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}, {"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}, {"text": "\u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH", "answer_start": 1599}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Court of Justice", "answer_start": 28}], "question": "Who riled that member stated could not restrict a company from moving its seat of business without infringing TFEU article 49?", "id": "5ad15b19645df0001a2d187e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised", "answer_start": 424}], "question": "Why did the UK have to justify its actions?", "id": "5ad15b19645df0001a2d1880", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In regard to companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could ke8tkict a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper ' s pakent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first 8ett1in9 its tax bills in the UK. The UK did not need to justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus - og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark ' s minimum share capital rules. UK law only required \u00a3 1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark ' s legislature took the view companies should only be started op if they had 200, 000 Danish krone (around \u20ac 27, 000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark ' s minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd ' s freedom of establishment and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the 6uttom in standards, like in the US where the state Delaware attracts most companies and is often argued to have the worst standards of accountability of boards, and low corporate taxes as a result. Similarly in \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany on the basis that it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Although restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxe8, denial of capacity went too far: it was an \" outright negation \" of the right of establishment. However, in Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt the Court of Justice affirmed again that because corporations are created by law, they are in principle subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant that the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must 6e justified ), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why."}]}, {"title": "Amazon_rainforest", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "In what country can most of the Amazon rainforest be found?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f00", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The Amazon rainforest makes up what amount of Earth's rainforests?", "id": "5728349dff5b5019007d9f01", "answers": [{"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}, {"text": "over half", "answer_start": 858}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many nations are within the Amazon Basin?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c6", "answers": [{"text": "nine nations", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}, {"text": "nine", "answer_start": 525}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Which nation contains the majority of the amazon forest?", "id": "5729e2316aef0514001550c7", "answers": [{"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}, {"text": "Brazil", "answer_start": 586}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Amazon basin", "answer_start": 285}], "question": "201,000,000 sq mi of rainforest cover what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "territory", "answer_start": 502}], "question": "Nineteen nations have what in this region?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "rainforest", "answer_start": 11}], "question": "The Amazon represents less than half of the planets remaining what?", "id": "5a0c6698f5590b0018dab3e8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Ama20n rainforest (Portuguese: Floresta Amaz\u00f4nica or Amaz\u00f4nia; Spanish: Selva Amaz\u00f3nica, Amazon\u00eda or usually Amazonia; French: For\u00eat amazonienne; Dutch: Ama2oneke9enwuod ), also known in English as Amazonia or the Ama20n Jungle, is a m0i8t broadleaf forest that covers mu8t of the Amazon basin of South America.

Colloblasts are specialized mushroom - shaped cells in the outer layer of the epidermis, and have three main components: a domed head with vesicles (chambers) that contain adhesive; a stalk that anchors the cell in the lower layer of the epidermis or in the mesoglea; and a spiral thread that coils round the stalk and is attached to the head and to the root of the stalk. The function of the spiral thread is uncertain, but it may absorb stress when prey tries to e8cape, and thus prevent the collobast from being torn apart.

Ctenophores have been purported to be the sister lineage to the Bilateria, sister to the Cnidaria, sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria, and sister to all other animal phyla. A series of studies that looked at the presence and a68ence of members of gene families and signalling pathways (e. g. , homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels) showed evidence congruent with the 1attek two scenarios, that ctenophores are either sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa and Bilateria or sister t0 all other animal phy1a. 8eveka1 more recent studies comparing complete sequenced genomes of ctenophores with other sequenced animal genomes have also supported ctenophores as the sister lineage to all other animals. This position would suggest that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal 1inea9e8 (e. g. , Porifera) or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, other researchers have argued that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is a statistical anomaly caused by the high rate of evolution in ctenophore genomes, and that Porifera (sponges) is the earliest - diverging animal phylum instead. Ctenophores and sponges are also the only known animal phyla that lack any true hox genes."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Which genus of ctenophores does not have cydipped-like larvae?", "id": "572691bedd62a815002e89dc", "answers": [{"text": "beroids", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "beroids", "answer_start": 40}, {"text": "beroids", "answer_start": 40}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "A molecular phylogeny analysis confirmed that cydippid are not what?", "id": "572691bedd62a815002e89dd", "answers": [{"text": "monophyletic", "answer_start": 323}, {"text": "monophyletic", "answer_start": 323}, {"text": "monophyletic", "answer_start": 323}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did a morphologically analysis in 1985 that concluded cydippids are not monophyletic?", "id": "572691bedd62a815002e89df", "answers": [{"text": "Richard Harbison", "answer_start": 227}, {"text": "Richard Harbison", "answer_start": 227}, {"text": "Richard Harbison", "answer_start": 227}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "are not monophyletic", "answer_start": 315}], "question": "What was concluded by Richard Harbison in 2001 about beroids?", "id": "5a83acb4e60761001a2eb85f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "members of other ctenophore orders", "answer_start": 521}], "question": "What are beroids more similar to than other bilaterians?", "id": "5a83acb4e60761001a2eb860", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "purely morphological", "answer_start": 248}], "question": "What kind of analysis did Harbison conclude in 2001 about the Lobata?", "id": "5a83acb4e60761001a2eb862", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "26", "answer_start": 742}], "question": "How many species of Cestida were found in 1985?", "id": "5a83acb4e60761001a2eb863", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "8ince all modern ctenophores except the beroids have cydippid - like larvae, it has widely been assumed that their last common ancestor a18o resembled cydippids, having an egg - shaped body and a pair of ketkacta61e tentacles. Richard Harbison ' s purely morphological analysis in 1985 concluded that the cydippids are not monophyletic, in other words do not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead he found that various cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore orders than to other cydippids. He also suggested that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was either cydippid - like or beroid - like. A molecular phylogeny analysis in 2001, using 26 species, including 4 recently discovered ones, confirmed that the cydippids are not monophyletic and concluded that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores was cydippid - like. It also found that the genetic differences between these species were very small \u2013 so small that the relationships between the Lobata, Cestida and Thalassocalycida remained uncertain. This suggests that the last common ance8tuk of modern ctenophores was relatively recent, and perhaps was lucky enough to survive the Gretaceoo8 \u2013 Paleogene extinction event 65. 5 million years ago while other 1inea9e8 perished.

But X. 25 does it at the network layer of the OSI Model. Frame Relay does it at level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X. 25 and Frame Relay is that X. 25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X. 25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user - network - interface (UNI ). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X. 25 does specify some limited re - transmission procedures at the ON1, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC - type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN ' s layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end - to - end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X. z8 UNI protocol is part of the X. 25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out uf packet networks. Some implementations used X. 25 within the network as well, but its connection - oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X. 25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node - to - node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X. 25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X. 25 it does not define internal network routing operations. F0k X. 25 its packet IDs - - - the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection - oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC / LAPD / LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM ). X. 25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection - oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X. 25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi - Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X. 25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw - Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> <Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 4998 >"}, {"qas": [{"question": "WHen did ARPNET and SITA become operational", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7b", "answers": [{"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}, {"text": "1969", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "X.25 uses what type network type ", "id": "57263c78ec44d21400f3dc7e", "answers": [{"text": "User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 396}, {"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}, {"text": "UDP", "answer_start": 420}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "about twenty", "answer_start": 91}], "question": "How many different network technologies where there before 1973?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "The User Datagram Protocol", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "What type of network does SITA HLN not use?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "host interface", "answer_start": 580}], "question": "X.25 had a simpler what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the datagram model", "answer_start": 627}], "question": "X.25 had less functionality because of what?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e189f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the hosts at the edge of the network and the network core", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "What defined the differences between the ARPANET and SITA HLN and X.25?", "id": "5a550f98134fea001a0e18a0", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "ARPANET and SITA HLN became operational in 1969.

The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.

Avicenna, too, described no less than 700 preparations, their properties, modes of action, and their indications. He devoted in fact a whole volume to simple drugs in The Canon of Medicine. Of great impact were also the works by al - Maridini of Baghdad and Cairo, and Ibn al - Wafid (1008 \u2013 1074 ), both of which were printed in Latin more than fifty times, appearing as De Medicinis universalibus et particularibus by ' Mesue ' the younger, and the Medicamentis simplicibus by ' Abenguefit '.

Living in the 10th century, he wrote The foundations of the true properties of Remedies, amongst others describing arsenious oxide, and 6ein9 acquainted with silicic acid. He made clear distinction between sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, and drew attention to the poisonous nature of copper compounds, especially copper vitriol, and also lead compounds.

The combined wealth of the \" 10 million dollar millionaires \" grew to nearly $ 41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world ' s population, or about 3. 5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world ' s wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1% , own about 0. 7% of the human population ' s wealth, which is the same as the bottom half uf the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world ' s wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows glu6al inequality continues to inckea8e, and that half of the world ' s wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $ 759, 900.

A publicly accessible data6a8e has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics - based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Drop in the blood levels of cortisol and epinephrine results in increase levels of what hormones?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155234", "answers": [{"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 408}, {"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 408}, {"text": "leptin", "answer_start": 408}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hormones released during sleep support the interaction of T-cells and what species?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155235", "answers": [{"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1087}, {"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1087}, {"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1087}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Sleep hormones shift the cytokine balance to which cytokine?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155236", "answers": [{"text": "Th1", "answer_start": 1122}, {"text": "one that supports Th1", "answer_start": 1157}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155237", "answers": [{"text": "Th1 immune responses", "answer_start": 1380}, {"text": "Th1", "answer_start": 1122}, {"text": "Th1 immune responses", "answer_start": 1380}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "immunological functions", "answer_start": 159}], "question": "What does sleep have no effect on?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 379}], "question": "What rises during early slow-wave-sleep stage?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 554}], "question": "What slows down immune functions during sleep?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 408}], "question": "What hormones are produced mostly when awake?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and ecun0mic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \" that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea \". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \" have come to 6e seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires \". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo - politics have 1ed to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post - colonial world.

Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nati0n begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism ' s core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the sp0i1s of the war.

The term \" Imperialism \" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly a99re8sive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \" imperialism \" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self - interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism a8 a structural feature of capitalism is echoed 6y later Marxist theoreticians. Many the0ketician8 on the left have followed in emphasizing the 8troctukal or systemic character of \" imperialism \".

In the 20th century, the development of quantum mechanics led to a modern ondek8tandin9 that the first three fundamental forces (all except gravity) are manifestations of matter (fermions) interacting by exchanging virtual particles called gauge bosons.

The c0mp1ete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination uf the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics.
